Program to enter 10 numbers into an array and print it
Program to enter 10 numbers into an array and print it in reverse order
Program to enter 10 numbers into an array and print the values of those cells whose subscripts are odd
Program to initialise an array of 5 elements and print their sum and average
Program to accept 20 numbers in an array amd print only the even values
Program to accept values into 2 different arrays of 10 numbers each. Store the sum of the 2 arrays in a separate array and print it
Two single dimensinal arrays contain values as follows:
   X[10] = {5, -3, -2, 1, 0, 12, 14, 16, 25, 13}
   Y[8] = {6, 5, 10, 15l 18, 20, 22, 30}
   
   Write a program that results in a third array as follows:
   Z[18] = {5, 6, -3, 5, -2, 10, 1, 15, 0, 18, 12, 20, 14, 22, 16, 30, 25, 13}
